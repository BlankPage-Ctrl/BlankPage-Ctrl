# 👋 Hi there, I'm Wilfredo (aka BlankPage-Ctrl)

I'm a passionate full-stack developer currently focused on building high-security systems and cross-platform apps using Electron, Node.js, and Vue. I build tools with strong encryption and modern architecture — because privacy **shouldn't be optional**.

## 🧠 What I Do
- 🔐 Building **high-security apps** with encryption (AES, RSA, E2EE), RBAC & ABAC
- 🖥️ Developing **Electron-based desktop applications** (multi-tenant, modular, optimized)
- 📊 Designing **data management systems** with scalable PostgreSQL and MySQL backends
- 💡 Architecting and optimizing systems with focus on **performance + protection**

## 🧭 Vision & Philosophy

I don’t just build code — I **design systems** that prioritize **data safety**, **efficiency**, and **control**.

> "When you're building for real people and real problems, every layer of protection counts."

Whether it's a student database or a full E2EE chat engine, I aim to build tools that give users **confidence**, not just features.
